# -Local-Service-Landing-Pages-with-AI-Generated-Visuals
Designed two AI-enhanced landing pages for local services — home cleaning and dog grooming — using Lovable.dev.. Each page features custom visuals, clear calls to action, and testimonial sections to build trust and drive bookings. The project demonstrates how AI tools can support small businesses with professional, conversion-ready web design.

🖼️ Local Service Landing Pages with AI-Generated Visuals
Project 4 – TripleTen AI Automation Program Created by Francois O Yengue

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how AI-generated visuals and no-code tools can empower small businesses to create professional landing pages that drive customer engagement. I designed two landing pages — one for a home cleaning service and one for a dog grooming service — using Lovable.dev and custom AI-generated images. Each page includes clear calls to action, testimonial sections, and polished layouts tailored to the business goals.

🧼 Service 1: Home Cleaning
Landing Page: PristinePro Home Cleaning

Business Goal: Collect service requests and quote inquiries for professional home cleaning.

✅ How the Page Supports the Goal
Clearly presents services with clean design and simple language.

Emphasizes trust, professionalism, and convenience.

CTA (“Get a Quote”) is prominently placed and functional.

AI-generated visuals show sparkling rooms and friendly cleaners.

Testimonials reinforce reliability and customer satisfaction.

🐶 Service 2: Dog Grooming
Landing Page: Pawsitive Grooming

Business Goal: Encourage pet owners to book grooming appointments online.

✅ How the Page Supports the Goal
Inviting layout with cheerful, well-groomed dogs in the hero section.

CTA (“Book Now”) guides users to schedule appointments easily.

AI visuals and icons reflect a caring, professional pet salon.

Testimonials build trust and highlight customer satisfaction.

Page feels polished and ready for real business use.
